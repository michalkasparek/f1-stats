My pandas and Jupyter Notebook playground.

Fun facts found so far:

- 2019 has been the first and so far only season with only European drivers on podiums.

- Jan Magnussen ended his career with his best result (6th place). 14 years later, his son Kevin started his own F1 career with what still is his personal best (2nd place). Both have the longest careers among the drivers with similar fates.

- Lewis Hamilton would have won the most European F1 Championship titles (only points achieved by European drivers on European circuits get counted towards the fantasy EF1C). Although Stirling Moss hasn't ever become a World Champion, he would have been a 5-time European Champion!

- Michael Andretti had a 46percent chance of ending his race in a crash. That's the highest rate among drivers with at least 10 entries.

- Max Verstappen is the first World Champion with Farina Number 7 â€“ which means 7 degrees of separation between him and Nino Farina. Nino Farina was number 0; the last competing driver who had raced against Farina was Maurice Trintignant (1); Chris Amon was the last driver with FN 2, Alan Jones with FN 3 etc.

- For more than 45 years, there were active drivers in F1 that had raced (or would race) against Jan Lammers, Nelson Piquet and Riccardo Patrese.

- Since 2007, polesitters have better chances for a win in Monza, Spa or Montreal than in Monaco.
