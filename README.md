My [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) sandbox.

Fun facts found so far:

- 2019 was the first and so far only season with only European drivers on podiums.

- Jan Magnussen ended his career with his best result (6th place). 14 years later, his son Kevin started his own F1 career with his own personal best (2nd place). Both have the longest careers among the drivers with similar fates.

- Not a single driver has ever knowingly ended his F1 career with a satisfying victory.

- Lewis Hamilton has won the most European F1 Championship titles (only points achieved by European drivers on European circuits get counted towards EF1C). Although Stirling Moss hasn't ever become a World Champion, he would be a 5-time European Champion!

- Michael Andretti had a 46percent chance of ending his race in a crash. That's the highest rate among drivers with at least 10 entries.

- Since 2007, it's more likely to win from the pole in Monza, Spa or Montreal than in Monaco.

I fed the ```data/``` folder with these CSVs: [www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020](http://ergast.com/mrd/db/#csv).
