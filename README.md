Fun facts found so far:

- Jan Magnussen closed his career with his best result (6th place) in the 1998 Canadian Grand Prix. 16 years later, his son Kevin started his own F1 career with what still remains his personal best (2nd place). Both have the longest careers among the drivers with similar fates.

- Lewis Hamilton would have won the most European F1 Championship titles (only points achieved by European drivers on European circuits get counted towards the fantasy EF1C). Although Stirling Moss hasn't ever become a World Champion, he would have been a 5-time European Champion!

- More than one third of F1 drivers have competed against Graham Hill.

- Michael Andretti had a 46% chance of ending his race in a crash – the highest rate among drivers with at least 10 entries.

- Max Verstappen is the first World Champion with Farina Number 7 – which means 7 degrees of separation between him and Giuseppe "Nino" Farina, the first race winner and World Champion. (Nino Farina was number 0; Maurice Trintignant was the last driver with FN 1, competing directly with Nino; Chris Amon was the last driver with FN 2, Alan Jones with FN 3 etc.)

- From 1967 to 2012, there was at least one active driver in F1 each season that had raced against Jan Lammers, Nelson Piquet, and Riccardo Patrese. This record was broken in 2022 Singapore GP, with Jean Alesi, Eddie Irvine, Mika Häkkinen, Luca Badoer, Rubens Barrichello, and Michael Schumacher having the new longest "extended lifespan", going from 1977 to 2022.

- Since 2007, polesitters have been more likely to win in Monza, Spa or Montreal than in Monaco.

- 2019 has been the first and so far only season with only European drivers on podiums.
